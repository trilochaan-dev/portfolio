Lighting Lettering is a font that zips across the page!

With its speedy italic design and rounded square look, Lighting Lettering injects a sense of modern urgency. Sports branding and tech products, or even the titles of a high-octane racing game, are some of its uses. 

The font is built with advanced OpenType functionality and guaranteed top-notch quality, containing stylistic and contextual alternates, ligatures and more automatic and manual features; all to give you full control and customizability. 
It has extensive lingual support, covering all Latin-based languages, from North Europa to South Africa, from America to South-East Asia. It contains all characters and symbols you'll ever need, including all punctuation and numbers. 

I wanted to capture the essence of speed and innovation in a single typeface. Lighting Lettering is the result â€“ a font that's both functional and visually electrifying.
